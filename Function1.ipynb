        "Generators yield one item at a time and do not store the entire sequence in memory.\n",

        "\n",
        "Example: Iterating over a huge file line by line with a generator avoids loading the whole file into memory.\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators produce items on demand, which means they calculate values only when needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "This leads to faster startup time and better performance for large or infinite sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Improved Performance\n",
        "\n",
        "Since generators yield values as needed, they often run faster in terms of initial execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "This can be beneficial for pipelines or streaming data applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Infinite Sequences\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators can model infinite sequences (e.g., Fibonacci numbers, data streams) because they don't require allocating memory for all elements in advance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Cleaner Code with Iteration\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators make it easy to write custom iterators using the yield keyword, leading to simpler and more readable code than managing state manually in a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Composability\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators can be chained together to create data pipelines (e.g., generator expressions, filtering, mapping), leading to concise and expressive code.\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "   -  A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. It can take any number of arguments but only has one expression. The result of the expression is implicitly returned.\n",
